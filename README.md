This repository contains a JavaScript function that attempts to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using recursion.  However, the implementation contains errors that lead to incorrect results and potential stack overflow issues.  The `bug.js` file demonstrates the flawed implementation, and the `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. The incorrect implementation demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: improper handling of base cases and logic errors in recursive calls.
